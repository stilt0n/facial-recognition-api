# THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY BROKEN, I WILL HOPEFULLY HAVE IT FIXED SOON
Update:  I got a chance to try to figure out the problem with this app.  I'm embarrassed to say that it looks like I deleted the entire back end off of Heroku to make room for another app.  Now it's not a such a shock why the login has suddenly stopped working.  I will hopefully have this fixed in the next couple of days.
