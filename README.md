# facial-recognition-api

## Project Details
This is the back-end for a React Web App that allows for user registration, logging in, and for a user to submit an image url for facial recognition.  The facial recognition makes use of Clarifai's image recognition API, routing is done with Express, and the logins are stored in a postgres database.  The whole project is deployed on Heroku.

## What I learned
Doing this project taught me how to work with React, and gave me some understanding of how web frameworks work differently from, say, building a page with HTML and vanilla JavaScript.  I also learned about using third party APIs, making a server and database, and having a front-end and back-end interact with each other.
